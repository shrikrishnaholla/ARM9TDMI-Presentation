This is a presentation created for my college seminar on ARM9TDMI processor. You can download the sources from here.
This presentation is inspired from a similar project called impress.js <http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js>
Refer to the original project if you are interested in creating something similar...
Happy Coding... :)
